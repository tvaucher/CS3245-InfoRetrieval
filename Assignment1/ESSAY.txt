1. In the homework assignment, we are using character-based ngrams,
i.e., the gram units are characters. Do you expect token-based ngram
models to perform better?

2. What do you think will happen if we provided more data for each
category for you to build the language models? What if we only
provided more data for Indonesian?

3. What do you think will happen if you strip out punctuations and/or
numbers? What about converting upper case characters to lower case?

4. We use 4-gram models in this homework assignment. What do you think
will happen if we varied the ngram size, such as using unigrams,
bigrams and trigrams?
